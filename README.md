# Tanoa - is a collaborative whiteboard tool for teams (prototype)

It is a prototype of a realtime whiteboard tool which allow users to create and manage their boards. Users can create an organization then invite other members to be part of it. All members can collaborate at the same time and the updates will be visible in realtime. All CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations were implemented.

## Tech Stack

**Client/Server:** Nextjs (client and server), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.

**DB/Tools:** Convex, Clerk, LiveBlocks, Zustand, and small dependecies such as react-contenteditable

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

By building this project I learnt more about Convex and how to work with realtime data. My biggest challenges were working with technologies I had no previous knowledge about such us LiveBlocks. It required me to read their documentation and watch tutorials for further understanding.
